(1)Run "Application Compiler" inside Matlab
(2)Select "run_fcd_maps.m" as main script
(3)In "File required for your application to run" you have to select manually:
	* <spm_dir>\tpm (affine registration templates directory)
	* <spm_dir>\toolbox\OldNorm (Affine registration scripts directory)
	* <spm_dir>\toolbox\cat12\templates_MNI152NLin2009cAsym (Shooting registration templates directory)
	* <spm_dir>\Contents.txt (File required for deploying SPM12 application)
	* <spm_dir>\toolbox\cat12\Contents.txt (File required for deploying CAT12 application)
	* \utils (directory of this proyect)
	* (optional-check NOTES) \cat12_modules (directory of this proyect)

Notes:
>In case you want to modify the parameters of the cat12 prepro module after compilation, you should have "cat12_modules" dir alongside with the "run_fcd_maps.exe". Remember to not add it as a requirement in the compilation.
